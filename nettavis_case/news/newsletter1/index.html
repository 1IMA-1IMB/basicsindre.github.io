                Several media outlets, including Variety, report that Kanye West (46) appeared on stage during a Travis Scott concert in Rome on Monday night. West hasn't been seen on stage since his initial antisemitic statement in October last year. <br><br>
                It was during the review of his new album, 'Utopia,' that Travis Scott (32) welcomed West to perform 'Praise God' and 'Canâ€™t Tell Me Nothing'. <br><br>
                The introduction from Scott was: 'There's no 'Utopia' without Kanye West. There's no Travis Scott without Kanye West. There's no Rome without Kanye West. Make some noise for Ye. <br><br>
                Kanye West's antisemitic statements last year received strong condemnation from several Jewish organizations, leading to his suspension from several social media platforms. However, he is now back on Elon Musk's platform X, formerly known as Twitter. <br><br>
                He also lost valuable financial partnerships with companies like Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga after Ari Emanuel, the chairman of the entertainment giant Endeavour, who himself comes from a Jewish background, urged companies to sever business ties with West. <br><br>
                Kanye West responded on Instagram, as reported by Variety, saying, "Ari Emanuel. I lost two billion dollars in one day. And I'm still alive. This is a love story. I still love you, God still loves you. Money isn't who I am. People are who I am." <br><br>
                Variety also notes that West's previous stage appearance was during the launch of his "Donda 2" album in Miami in February last year. He was accompanied by several controversial artists, including DaBaby, who had faced strong criticism for homophobic remarks the year before, and Marilyn Manson, who has faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.
