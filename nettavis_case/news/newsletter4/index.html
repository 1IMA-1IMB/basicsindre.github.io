              Kanye West has apparently announced that his new joint album with Ty Dolla $ign will be released on Friday 15 December, marking his return to music after a string of widely publicised controversies. <br><br>
              In a club appearance over the weekend with fellow rapper Ty Dolla $ign, West, who legally changed his name to Ye last year, was reportedly heard announcing the record: “It’s called Vultures, and it’s coming out this Friday.” <br><br>
              Ty Dolla $ign also announced that a listening party would be held on Tuesday 12 December in Miami. <br><br>
              West, 46, previously debuted the title track during a surprise performance at Dubai nightclub Blu, where it emerged that the song included West rapping: “How am I antisemitic? I just f***** a Jewish b****.” <br><br>
              Adidas ended its years-long partnership with West after he made a number of “unacceptable, hateful and dangerous” comments about Jewish people. <br><br>
              Shortly after this, he caused further uproar by declaring that he “liked Hitler” during an interview with right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his channel, Infowars. Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes was also being interviewed on the programme. <br><br>
              West’s last major release was his 2021 album Donda, itself a controversial project that included an appearance by Marilyn Manson, just weeks after the rock musician was accused of sexual and physical abuse by multiple women. <br><br>
              Manson denied all of the allegations against him, insisting that his “intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners”.

            <p class="newslettertext">
              Last week, Ty Dolla $ign shared a tracklist for the new album to Instagram, with song titles including “Lifestyle”, “Worship”, Beg Forgiveness”, and “Drunk”. <br><br>
              It will also include the track “Back to Me”, after a low-quality video of West and TY Dolla $ign listening to the clip surfaced on social media in October. <br><br>
              Rumoured guest artists include Future and Playboi Carti, while reports suggest that the duo could sample the Backstreet Boys and singer Leon Bridges. <br><br>
              West has a track record of announcing albums then failing to release them on schedule. He announced two albums in 2020 that have yet to be released: God’s Country and Donda: With Child. <br><br>
              Donda was also delayed by a month, while Jesus is King, originally titled Yandhi, was set for release in August 2018 but eventually came out as Jesus is King in October the following year, after a further four missed released dates. <br><br>
              The Vultures release has already been postponed from a “multi-stadium listening event” that was announced for 3 November 2023.
